#What is Svelte?

- A front-end and framework like React or Angular or Vue
- However, it's based on a compiler, not a  JavaScript library
- If you look at the package.json, you'll see there is **no dependencies section**
- In other words, no framework code exists at runtime
- Your code compiles down to pure application-specific HTML & JavaScript
