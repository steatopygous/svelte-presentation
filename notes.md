#Other Lifecycle Methods

Less frequently used lifecycle methods are:

- **onDestroy()**, called when the component is removed from the DOM
- **beforeUpdate()**, called immediately before each DOM update
- **afterUpdate()**, called immediately after each DOM update
- **tick()**, which allows code to be run at the start of the next cycle
